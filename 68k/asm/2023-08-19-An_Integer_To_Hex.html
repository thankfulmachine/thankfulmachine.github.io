<h1>An Integer to Hex</h1>
<p>One of the most useful things you can do when bringing up a homebrew
computer is to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code_monitor">monitor program</a>.</p>
<p>A monitor program must be able to display the contents of memory and
it is typical to display memory as hexadecimal values. So, let us
create a function to do just that.</p>
<p>One hexadecimal digit can convey a place value of 0 to 15, or 0 to F
in hex.  This corresponds to the upper and lower nibble of a byte, so
we'll convert a byte as &quot;two halves&quot;, making two hexadecimal
characters.</p>
<p>A hexadecimal string can contain the following letters:</p>
<pre><code>hexchars: dc.b '0123456789ABCDEF'
</code></pre>
<p>That is stored in the assembled program as an array of ASCII bytes.
Somehow, we must turn the value itself into an index into this array.
For the purposes of this article, we will only consider byte values.</p>
<pre><code>; void byte_to_hex_str(unsigned char value, char *out);
; Renders a two-character hex string for the given
; `value` to the `out` address.
byte_to_hex_str:
</code></pre>
<p>This procedure will take a single byte argument, which is promoted to
a longword and passed via the stack per the <a href="https://m680x0.github.io/doc/abi.html">M68k ABI</a>.</p>
<p>The register where we are working with the <code>value</code> argument may have
data left in the upper bits, so we'll clear that first. Then we'll
copy the byte out of the stack. Notice that the offset from the stack
pointer is 7, as we're dealing with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness">big-endian</a> machine.</p>
<pre><code>clr d0                 ; d0 = 0
move.b 7(sp),d0        ; d0 = 0b000000000000000000000000uuuullll
</code></pre>
<p>We're going to modify this directly to work with one nibble, but we'll
need to recover the other one later. So, make a copy of this value.</p>
<pre><code>move.l d0,d1           ; Copy d0 into d1
</code></pre>
<p>Next, we'll need the base address of the hexchars string so we can
index into it.</p>
<pre><code>lea hexchars,a0        ; a0 = start address of
                       ; the hexchars string.
</code></pre>
<p>We'll also need the address of the destination where to render the
string. This was passed as the second argument on the stack.</p>
<pre><code>movea.l 8(sp),a1       ; a1 = destination address
                       ; to render the string.
</code></pre>
<p>Now we'll render the upper nibble.</p>
<pre><code>; Render the upper nibble
lsr #4,d0              ; d0 &gt;&gt;= 4;
                       ; Shift the high nibble down into place.
                       ; d0 = 0b0000000000000000000000000000uuuu

move.b (a0,d0),(a1)+   ; *a1++ = hexchars[d0]
</code></pre>
<p>Now this leverages some unique capabilities. This copies a character
from the <code>hexchars</code> array into the destination depending on the
nibble's value, making use of two addressing modes that make C-like
code very idiomatic in 68000 assembly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Address Register Indirect with Index (a0,d0) <a href="https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/reference-manual/M68000PRM.pdf">(Motorola 2-10)</a></li>
<li>Address Register Indirect with Postincrement (a1)+ <a href="https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/reference-manual/M68000PRM.pdf">(Motorola 2-6)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As Thomas Gunter says, &quot;totally contrary to the principle of RISC&quot; <a href="https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2012/04/102658164-05-01-acc.pdf">(CHM 9)</a>.</p>
<p>The former is effectively array indexing, which is of course useful.
The latter is convenient because it stores to the address in <code>a1</code> and
also increments address <code>a1</code> afterword, ready for a subsequent write,
as one does for a string of values in an array. We'll take advantage
of that.</p>
<p>Now we'll render the lower nibble directly out of the copy we made
earlier. Mask off the upper bits and render as we did before.</p>
<pre><code>; Render the lower nibble
andi.b #%1111,d1       ; d1 &amp;= 0b1111
move.b (a0,d1),(a1)    ; *a1 = hexchars[d1]
rts                    ; Return from subroutine
</code></pre>
<p>A couple of things to note about this subroutine:</p>
<ul>
<li>To keep things flexible as to where the string can be rendered, such
as the middle of a string, the subroutine does not set a null
terminator character in the destination string.</li>
<li>The destination must be able to hold at least 2 bytes safely. Take
care with the out address argument.</li>
</ul>
<p>Later, we'll expand on this to print a classic memory listing by doing
the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read multiple bytes from a single starting address</li>
<li>Print an ASCII interpretation on the side</li>
</ul>
