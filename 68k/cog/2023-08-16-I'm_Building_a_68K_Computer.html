<h1>I'm Building a 68k Computer</h1>
<p>Or rather, I did, as you may have seen on Mastodon. I'll be going
through my brief little journey getting it running as a series of
short posts.</p>
<p>The Motorola 68000 is a bit of a frontier to me. Up to this point, I
didn't know much about the architecture, but love many of the machines
that used it, like the Amiga, Sharp X68000, Sega Mega Drive, among
many others.</p>
<p>Having programmed the NES, Game Boy, DOS, PlayStation 1, and modern
computers, there was a distinct hole where the 68000, 8086, and 65816
should be. I already know enough about the latter two to know that I'm
not interested at this time ^^. However, the more I learned about the
architecture and instruction set of the 68000, I knew I wanted it to
be the real representative of my knowledge about this era.</p>
<p>The 16-bit era has a particular feeling that is difficult to place.
The sound chips began to blossom with samples and FM synthesis, whilst
still remaining primitive enough to maintain a distinct identity. The
same goes for graphics. Once the 32-bit era arrived, with 3D graphics
and streaming CD-quality audio, everything very quickly became just
another PC lacking a unique experience or identity. This was
especially stark for consoles after the PlayStation 2, in my humble
opinion.</p>
<p>The 68000 lies in a sweet spot. With 8 data registers, 8 address
registers, and an instruction set allowing many operations on any
registers, there is a modest beauty and reasonable complexity to it.
There is even a sensible default ABI for C programs. It has a lot
going for it.  Whilst I tend to favor RISC architectures for their
sheer elegance and simplicity, there is much to admire about the
68000.</p>
