<h1>Thomas Gunter's 68000 Regrets</h1>
<p>During the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaHtGf4aRLs">Motorola 68000 Oral History Panel</a> from the <a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/collections/catalog/102658164">Computer
History Museum</a>, Thomas Gunter, the director of the 68000 program,
noted a few regrets around the development of the 68000 <a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/collections/catalog/102658164">(CHM 9)</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Should have gone with a CMOS implementation earlier</li>
<li>Didn't get a floating point unit until the 68020</li>
<li>&quot;We created a monster in terms of all of the addressing modes&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>That last one is kind of an interesting point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As we went up the chain a little bit to 68010, 68020, we created a
monster in terms of all the addressing modes that we had. We thought
that adding more addressing modes was the way you made a machine
more powerful, totally contrary to the principle of RISC later.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is interesting to me because I find, as I'm programming the
68000, it has exactly the addressing modes I would expect. They're
very idiomatic to someone who has experience with C or C++. Perhaps he
was speaking as a designer, the logic needed to implement them all
must have been challenging. All that said, I find them to be just
enough <a href="https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/reference-manual/M68000PRM.pdf">(NXP 2-4)</a>:</p>
<pre><code>Data Register Direct
Address Register Direct
Immediate Data
Absolute
Address Register Indirect
Address Register Indirect with Postincrement
Address Register Indirect with Predecrement
Address Register Indirect with Displacement
Address Register Indirect with Index (8-Bit Displacement)
Address Register Indirect with Index (Base Displacement)
Memory Indirect Postindexed
Memory Indirect Preindexed
Program Counter Indirect with Displacement
Program Counter Indirect with Index (8-Bit Displacement)
Program Counter Indirect with Index (Base Displacement)
Program Counter Memory Indirect Postindexed
Program Counter Memory Indirect Preindexed
</code></pre>
<p>Most of these I wouldn't want to live without. Perhaps the PC-relative
addressing modes weren't absolutely necessary but, with a large
address space, being able to load relocatable code is very useful.</p>
<p>Contrast these with the 6502's addressing modes <a href="https://www.westerndesigncenter.com/wdc/documentation/w65c02s.pdf">(WDC 15)</a>:</p>
<pre><code>Accumulator
Immediate
Absolute
Implied
Absolute Indirect
Absolute Indexed Indirect 
Absolute Indexed With X
Absolute Indexed With Y
Stack
Program Counter Relative
Zero Page
Zero Page Indexed Indirect
Zero Page Indexed With X
Zero Page Indexed With Y
Zero Page Indirect
Zero Page Indirect Indexed With Y
</code></pre>
<p>About the same cognitive load to my mind. The 68000 does have some
more refined variants to some of these, especially for indexing but
overall not too terribly different.</p>
