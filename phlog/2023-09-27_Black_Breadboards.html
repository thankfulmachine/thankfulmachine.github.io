<h1>Black Breadboards from BusBoard!</h1>
<p>I've been wanting to adjust the layout and rewire the Bebop 68000
computer on the breadboard but I wanted this one to look special in
some way. I decided to try for black breadboards to evoke that Mega
Drive/X68000/Neo Geo aesthetic, and see if anyone makes neon colored
PVC 22 AWG solid hookup wire for contrast.</p>
<p>While I didn't have any luck finding interesting wire, I did have
great luck with the breadboards. As it turns out, no one is really
making breadboards in interesting colors except for the small,
170-tie-point kind you see everywhere.</p>
<p>In early September I e-mailed the folks at <a href="http://www.busboard.com">BusBoard Prototype
Systems</a> whether they made their BB830 in black. The BB830 has a
standard 830 tie-points, probably the size you think of when you hear
&quot;breadboard&quot;. I'm a fan of their stuff as they use high quality metal
connectors.</p>
<p>To my surprise, they e-mailed me back and said that they had some!
Either they don't make enough to be generally for sale, or perhaps
they are working on making it an official product. I ordered a bunch
and they look great.</p>
<p>Big thanks to Nathan and Scot at BusBoard for answering a random
e-mail!</p>
<p>It never hurts to just ask.</p>
