<h1>Mirroring Gopher to HTML</h1>
<p>I'd like to mirror this content on a static HTTP server, but have been
unsure up to now how to do that to serve my needs without too much
complication.</p>
<p>On the one hand, I like writing HTML by hand, enjoy some of its basic
semantic features, and basic styling like choosing colors. However, I
also prefer the plain text simplicity of Gopher.  I've gone back and
forth on a few options:</p>
<ol>
<li>A custom HTML -&gt; Gopher converter, writing HTML first.</li>
<li>Lynx's <code>--dump</code> mode. I was surprised at the high quality of the
dumps that Lynx produced.</li>
<li>A custom Markdown -&gt; Gopher converter.</li>
<li>Somehow get Markdown to work as a gopher map.</li>
</ol>
<p>What I decided was something like option 4.</p>
<p>I like to use the phd server, which I have forked with a few
modifications for my own use at:
<a href="https://github.com/thankfulmachine/phd">https://github.com/thankfulmachine/phd</a>.</p>
<p>This server uses the Geomyidae format for links in gopher maps, which
interprets lines that look like this:</p>
<pre><code>[1|My Directory of Things|/mythings]
</code></pre>
<p>as a link in gophermaps. Aside from those, I'm basically writing
Markdown everywhere else in my plain text files and gopher maps out of
habit, so I've created a very small script that replaces these link
lines as:</p>
<ul>
<li>A little HTML region with an icon file, a la Mosaic directory
listings, or</li>
<li>An <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag for image links</li>
</ul>
<p>What remains is something that cmark can convert! It creates extremely
plain and boring HTML, which is exactly what I would write anyway.</p>
<pre><code>cmark --unsafe -t html
</code></pre>
<p>I'm pretty happy with this compromise: it allows me to write the
content as plain text first for my Gopher server and allow the website
to fill the role of a &quot;pretty proxy&quot;, without having to use an actual
proxy server. That works for me!</p>
