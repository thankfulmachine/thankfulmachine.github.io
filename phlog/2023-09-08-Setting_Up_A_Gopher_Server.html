<h1>Setting Up a Gopher Server on Ubuntu</h1>
<p>Here's a little walkthrough for setting up your own Gopher server on a
Virtual Private Server (VPS). I'll assume you found a VPS provider
that you like, are running Ubuntu 22.04 or a similar Linux
distribution that uses systemd, and know your way around a command
line.</p>
<h2>Managing your domain</h2>
<p>Once you've chosen a VPS provider, you'll be given an IP address,
hopefully both an IPv4 and IPv6 address. Create an <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records">A and AAAA</a>
record for your domain with your registrar that points to each of
these IP addresses respectively. The server we'll be using in this
tutorial should work fine with both IPv4 and IPv6.</p>
<h2>Install dependencies</h2>
<p>First, let's perform some operations as the root user.</p>
<p>The server I'll be using is <code>phd</code>, a small Rust implementation. We'll
compile it from scratch. Install the Rust compiler.</p>
<pre><code># apt install rustc
</code></pre>
<h2>Create a <code>gopher</code> user</h2>
<p>It's customary for servers with low port numbers to run as the root
user. Although Gopher uses port 70, I just don't like to run servers
as root, so I create a user called <code>gopher</code>:</p>
<pre><code># adduser gopherdpsrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr===========================
</code></pre>
<p>Excuse me, my dog insisted on laying her head on the keyboard. I'm
leaving it.</p>
<p>Anyway, as I was saying:</p>
<pre><code># adduser gopher
</code></pre>
<h2>Create a systemd service unit configuration file</h2>
<p>We'll be using systemd to manage the lifecycle of the phd process. For
that, we'll need a description of the service.</p>
<pre><code># cat /usr/lib/systemd/system/phd.service
[Unit]
Description=phd Gopher Server
After=network.target
StartLimitIntervalSec=0

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
RestartSec=1
User=gopher
WorkingDirectory=/home/gopher/SOME/PLACE
ExecStart=/home/gopher/.cargo/bin/phd -p 70 -h YOURHOSTNAME /home/gopher/SOME/PLACE

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
</code></pre>
<p>This will automatically launch the server once network access is up
and relaunch as needed.</p>
<p>Here, <code>/home/gopher/SOME/PLACE</code> will be the place where you'll place
all of your content. Make sure to adjust the path once you decide
where to put it. I put mine somewhere inside the <code>gopher</code> user's home
directory.</p>
<p>The <code>-h YOURHOSTNAME</code> option will automatically use this hostname for
links that don't have the hostname specified. This is very handy for
links within your own server.</p>
<p>The <code>-p 70</code> option will bind the customary port 70. The default is
7070, which can be handy for local testing, along with phd's <code>-r</code>
flag, which will render out the response for a given request.</p>
<h2>Install phd</h2>
<p>Let us switch over to the <code>gopher</code> user now, and build phd.</p>
<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/xvxx/phd.git
$ cd phd
$ cargo install --path .
</code></pre>
<p>This will install the <code>phd</code> executable to
<code>/home/gopher/.cargo/bin/phd</code>.</p>
<h2>Create some content!</h2>
<p>Now would be a good time to create the directory of your Gopher
server, if you haven't done so already. For more information on the
kinds of content you can put there, see <a href="https://github.com/xvxx/phd/blob/master/README.md">phd's README</a>.</p>
<pre><code>$ mkdir /home/gopher/SOME/PLACE
</code></pre>
<h2>Enable port 70 for the <code>phd</code> server</h2>
<p>Now, back to root user. Because we'll be running a Gopher server
from port 70 as a non-root user, we need to set a bit on the
executable so that it is allowed to bind that port. Some may disagree
with this approach. Feel free to run the server as <code>root</code> and skip
this step if it suits you.</p>
<pre><code># setcap CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE=+ep /home/gopher/.cargo/bin/phd 
</code></pre>
<p>You will need to do this each time you rebuild or reinstall the
executable. Keep this in mind if you decide to modify your server.</p>
<h2>Start it up!</h2>
<p>We should now be able to start the service and enable it for each
boot.</p>
<pre><code># systemctl reload-or-restart phd
# systemctl enable phd
</code></pre>
<p>Try a quick test to make sure the server is running:</p>
<pre><code># systemctl status phd
# echo &quot;/&quot; | nc grateful.garden 70
</code></pre>
<p>I found a tutorial, <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-systemctl-to-manage-systemd-services-and-units">How To Use Systemctl to Manage Systemd Services
and Units</a>, to be helpful for brushing up on my systemd knowledge.
I know many complain about systemd in the Linux world but, coming from
macOS, it seems pretty natural to me as most daemons are managed by
<code>launchd</code>, which I can only assume was the main inspiration.</p>
<p>If you are running into problems, you can view the service log:</p>
<pre><code># journalctl -u phd
</code></pre>
<h2>Encryption and security</h2>
<p>Although it's theoretically possibl, do note that there is no
encryption layer mentioned in the original <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1436">Gopher specification</a>
and I am not aware of any server or client that use TLS. The relative
bare nature of the application and transport of Gopher pages is
somewhat a part of Gopher culture, for better or worse.</p>
<h2>Who is sending me weird requests?</h2>
<p>As a low and attractive port 70, you will likely see various attempts
of &quot;research&quot; firms or bad actors poking at your server and seeing how
you'll respond. Here's an example from the log:</p>
<pre><code>Connection from [::ffff:192.241.226.33]:48372
Client sent: &quot;MGLNDD_194.195.86.14_70&quot;
Not found: /MGLNDD_194.195.86.14_70
</code></pre>
<p>It's up to you to figure out how to block these, although it may be
nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>As Gopher is a very naive protocol and old system understood
by a few retro nerds out there, I do not recommend running a server on
shared infrastructure or among data that you need to keep safe or
secret. Be careful out there.</p>
<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>Please do not take Gopher too seriously as a complete replacement for the
modern Web. All of that said, you perhaps are doing well avoiding the
complex risks of running a complete Web server. Everything here is
relatively simple and you are capable of understanding it.</p>
<p>Have fun with it.</p>
