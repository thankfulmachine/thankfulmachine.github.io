<h1>Dino Sweeper</h1>
<p>During my holiday break, I'm taking the time to learn some retro
Windows programming. I never really took the time to learn it
over the years, focusing mainly on *nix style operating systems,
so I feel I missed out on a lot of the fun during the peak OS
era of the late 90s and early 2000s. So, I thought a good little
project would be to reimplement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)">Mine Sweeper</a>. It holds a
special place in my heart and seems simple enough to implement.</p>
<p>I'm calling my little winmine clone &quot;Dino Sweeper&quot;. Instead of
searching for mines, you're searching for dinosaur fossils.
Dig in the wrong spot and you've ruined a precious specimen!</p>
<p>I've been putting together a Pentium III machine that will run
Windows 98 Second Edition and Windows 2000, where I'll be doing
my development. Until I get a few remaining components, I'll work
in a VM.</p>
<p>A couple of  impressions as I revisit this universe for the
first time in a couple of decades:</p>
<p>First, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_2000">Windows 2000</a> is perhaps still the greatest mainstream
operating system of all time, at least regarding the everyday
user experience. The surface area of the OS that you need to know
to live is small, the look and feel of the UI is so simple as to
be downright calming, and it's fast as hell. If you're reading this
phlog, I doubt I need to tell you how exhausted I must be of
&quot;modern&quot; UIs with their endless notifications, mental noise-inducing
compositing effects, and an ironic amount of emptiness.</p>
<p>Second, I'm using <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/1998/06/03/microsoft-unveils-visual-studio-6-0-enterprise-edition-at-tech-ed-developer-conference/">Visual Studio 6.0</a>, released in 1998.
Again, the simplicity. It launches pretty much instantaneously
and everything works as I expect so far.</p>
<p>As I dip my toes in the Win32 API, it's essentially
the same as everything else. Creating windows and menus,
handling UI events, open and closing files, loading resources,
etc. etc.</p>
<p>Nothing new under the sun.</p>
